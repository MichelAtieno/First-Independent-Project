             <em>ABOUT ME</em>
             </h1>
            <p>
            My name is Michel Atieno. I am currently a student at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/"><strong>Moringa School</strong></a>.<br>
            Two years ago, i had an interest in taking on entrepreneurship full time and I started working as a personal assistant for a small business owner. There was a computer and I had been self-teaching in html and css (months prior) but I did not have all the tools i needed to be successful.
            I was pretty good at running the business and most of the time, the owner left me alone to run things by myself. I gained a lot of skills in terms of being social, handling different types of situations sometimes hostile,keeping time and keeping accounts up-to-date.
            As much as I loved the job, In February 2017,I had reached a ceiling in terms of learning new things and I wanted a career. I resigned from the position and on the same day, I went and signed up for a class called Cisco Certified Networking Associate (CCNA). I knew nothing about it but after a few weeks into it, I was completely immersed.
            I spent so many hours on it without getting tired or frustrated because I was solving problems and making devices work, linking them, securing them etc.<br>
             I was also <strong> very curious </strong> about opportunities peers studying Computer Science were getting.
           After completing my CCNA certificate, I wanted to delve deeper into tech and that is how i ended up at <span class="italic"> Moringa School </span>.
           <br>
           The Prep Course at Moringa School has helped me discover more about myself and has most definitely elevated my skill level in creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving and most importantly soft skills required in a professional work environment.
            I must also say i have grown personally and I am more confident in undertaking tasks. The key has been more research, excessive practice and proper time-management.
            I hope to continue with the same spirit as i continue my software development journey and to be prepared for more challenges that I hope to solve.
