        <em>ABOUT ME</em>
       </h1>
       <p>
        My name is Michel Atieno. I am currently a student at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/"><strong>Moringa School</strong></a>.<br>
        Two years ago, i had an interest in taking on entrepreneurship full time and I started working as a personal assistant for a small business owner. There was a computer and I had been self-teaching in html and css (months prior) but I did not have all the tools i needed to be successful.
        I was pretty good at running the business and most of the time, the owner left me alone to run things by myself. I gained a lot of skills in terms of being social, handling different types of situations sometimes hostile,keeping time and keeping accounts up-to-date.
        As much as I loved the job, In February 2017,I had reached a ceiling in terms of learning new things and I wanted a career. I resigned from the position and on the same day, I went and signed up for a class called Cisco Certified Networking Associate (CCNA). I knew nothing about it but after a few weeks into it, I was completely immersed.
        I spent so many hours on it without getting tired or frustrated because I was solving problems and making devices work, linking them, securing them etc.<br>
        This is how my journey using technology became real. I was also <span class="italic"> very envious </span> of some of my peers who had studied Computer Science.
        After completing my CCNA certificate, I wanted to delve deeper into tech and that is how i ended up at <span class="italic"> Moringa School </span>.
